docker-services-boshworkspace
=============================

The fastest way to deploy [Docker Services](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/docker-boshrelease) in combination with [Cloud Foundry](http://www.cloudfoundry.org) onto [bosh-lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite).

### Preparation

To get started you will need a running bosh-lite. Get yours by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite#install-bosh-lite)

Next step is setting up this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/docker-services-boshworkspace.git
cd docker-services-boshworkspace
bundle install
```

### Deploy Cloud Foundry

With all prerequisites in place let deploy Cloud Foundry.

```
bosh deployment cf-warden
bosh prepare deployment
bosh deploy
```

### Deploy Docker Services

```
bosh deployment docker-warden
bosh prepare deployment
bosh deploy
cf create-service-broker docker containers containers http://cf-containers-broker.10.244.0.34.xip.io
# List services
cf service-access
cf enable-service-access <service_name>
```

### Deploy on AWS VPC

Assuming you used [terraform-aws-cf-install](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/terraform-aws-cf-install), ssh onto the Bastion server and run:
```
cd ~/workspace/deployments
git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/docker-services-boshworkspace.git
cd docker-services-boshworkspace
```

There is a helper script in `shell/populate-docker-aws-vpc` which will extract information from the cf-boshworkspace deployment on the bastion server and populate the variables in `deployments/docker-aws-vpc.yml`, a copy of the original file will be left in `deployments/docker-aws-vpc.yml.orig`.  Run the following on the bastion server:
```
cd ~/workspace/deployments/docker-services-boshworkspace/shell
./populate-docker-aws-vpc
```

You will still need to modify the SUBNET_ID in `deployments/docker-aws-vpc.yml`.  In AWS Console navigate to VPC > Subnets and select a subnet named "docker", the subnet id will be in the format "subnet-xxxxxxxx" and replace the value SUBNET_ID in the file

Your deployment manifest is now populated, launch the deployment from the bastion server:
```
cd ~/workspace/deployments/docker-services-boshworkspace
bosh deployment docker-aws-vpc
bosh prepare deployment
bosh -n deploy
```

By default, it assumes you are deploying into a `10.10.5.0/24` subnet. This is an optimization for users of [terraform-aws-cf-install](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/terraform-aws-cf-install) which creates this subnet for us.

#### Swarm & Offline images
There are alternative deployment files for using docker with swarm.
If you want to install the docker service broker without internet access be sure to checkout the offline deployments.
Which use the [docker-broker-images-boshrelease](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/docker-broker-images-boshrelease) for installing the docker images.

#### Alternate Network Configurations
If you want to deploy into another subnet CIDR, then add a `meta.subnets` to your deployment file to look something like:

```yaml
meta:
  subnets:
  - range: 10.10.5.0/24
  name: default_unused
  reserved:
    - 10.10.5.2 - 10.10.5.9
    static:
      - 10.10.5.10 - 10.10.5.250
      gateway: 10.10.5.1
      dns:
        - 10.10.0.2
        cloud_properties:
          security_groups: (( meta.security_groups ))
          subnet: (( meta.subnet_ids.docker ))
```
